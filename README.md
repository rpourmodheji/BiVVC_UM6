# Description

This files contains the circulatory model for four compartments of LV, Aorta, Veins and LA. All in linear and nonlinear elastance lumps. The elastance and resistance parameters are saved in two files elastance_parameters.yaml and resistance_parameters.yaml. Just for convenience. I adjusted the parameters to fit the experimental data. It will be useful later when the aorta membrane is added.
